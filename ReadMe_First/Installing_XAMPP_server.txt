Required Windows 10

1) Open up UAC(Used Account Settings)
   and scroll down the bar to "Never notify me when:"

2) Download XAMPP server  from https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/ or https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/5.6.28/xampp-win32-5.6.28-1-VC11-installer.exe
   Make sure XAMPP server is for php v5.6 or lower.
   Install XAMPP server the default way. No need to check or uncheck options during installation.
   Recommended location of installation 
   C:\xampp
   In case of Windows Security Alert, check the "Private networks, such as my home or work network" then click "Allow access"

3) Go to C: drive
   C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra
   open up "httpd-ssl" in notepad or textpad
   browse that file till you find "Listen 443"
   change this "Listen 443" to "Listen 8181"
   save that file.

   Go to C:\xampp\apache\conf
   open up "httpd" in notepad or textpad
   browser that file till you find "Listen 12.34.56.78:80"
				    Listen:80"
   change this to "Listen 12.34.56.78:1234"
		   Listen:1234"
   Also change "ServerName localhost:80" to "ServerName localhost:1234"

4) Go to XAMPP control panel and open up "Config" then go to "Service and Port Settings" and put "1234 in Main Port and "8181" in SSL Port, then click Save.

5) Open up xampp-control again, hopefully no errors are shown up there except a warning "You are running with Administrator rights!".

6) Type "cmd" in run window of windows 10 or just open up "Command Prompt" and run as administrator. 
   type "C:\WINDOWS\system32\net user" ( please note: "net user" has a space in between)
   and press enter
   now type "C:\WINDOWS\system32\net user administrator /active:yes" 			(type exactly the way it is shown)    
   now type "C:\WINDOWS\system32\net user administrator *"  (don't forget to include *)
   choose a new password for administrator if necessary
   
7) Log out from the current user. Log in as Administrator then open xampp-control and hopefully that warning is gone.
   Logging in as Administrator can bar you from using several Windows apps like Microsoft edge(I personally hate it :P) but one can fix it by going to "regedit.exe"
   in regedit go to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE then SOFTWARE then Microsoft then scroll down to Windows then CurrentVersion then scroll down to Policies then System and then find "FilterAdministratorToken" and change its "Value data:" to 1 and then go to UIPI and change its value data to 0x00000001(1)
   Restart the PC.

8) Go to C:\xampp\mysql\
   and replace the "data" folder with the one given. It contains the mysql databases.

9) Now go to C:\xampp
   and replace "htdocs" folder with the one given. It contains php codes and JpGraph libraries.

10) Now go to http:\\localhost:1234 and you shall see all the databases. If you cannot access any databases or encounter any problem, please feel free to ask me on mayazhussain@gmail.com or ayaz.hussain@tu-dortmund.de

11) Go to XAMPP Control Panel, click Start button on Apache and MySQL services

12) Now go to this link on Mozilla Firefox browser "http://localhost:1234/Graphs/accbarex1.php"(this link shall be used to download image in Augmented Reality App) and you shall see an accumulated bargraph.

13) Now go to this link on Mozilla Firefox browser "http://localhost:1234/phpmyadmin/" and this will open mySQL database. Go to "elections" then go to "participants3" and click "edit" and change the value and the graph at "http://localhost:1234/Graphs/accbarex1.php" should change accordingly.
